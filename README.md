Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x (for the backend)

Node.js and npm (for the frontend)

Git (for cloning the repository)

How to Run the Project
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy
git clone <repository-url>
Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning, navigate to the farmwise directory:

bash
Copy
cd farmwise
The directory contains two subdirectories:

backend (contains the Python-based backend)

frontend (contains the React-based frontend)

Step 3: Set Up the Backend
For Ubuntu/Linux/MacOS:
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy
cd backend
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-venv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
NOTE: Install:1) pip install python-jose
2)pip install pydantic[email]

Run the backend server:

bash
Copy
uvicorn main:app --reload
For Windows:
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy
cd backend
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the backend server:

bash
Copy
uvicorn main:app --reload
Step 4: Set Up the Frontend
For Ubuntu/Linux/MacOS:
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy
cd ../frontend
Check your Node.js and npm versions:

bash
Copy
node -v
npm -v
If not installed, install them:

bash
Copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Start the frontend server:

bash
Copy
npm start
For Windows:
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy
cd ../frontend
Check your Node.js and npm versions:

bash
Copy
node -v
npm -v
If not installed, download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.

Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Start the frontend server:

bash
Copy
npm start
Accessing the Application
The backend will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

The frontend will be running at http://localhost:3000.

Alternative for Running on Windows
If you prefer a more streamlined approach on Windows, you can use Docker to containerize the application. Here’s how:

Step 1: Install Docker
Download and install Docker Desktop from docker.com.

Step 2: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository as described earlier.

Step 3: Build and Run the Docker Containers
Navigate to the project root directory (farmwise).

Create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content:

yaml
Copy
version: '3.8'
services:
backend:
build: ./backend
ports: - "8000:8000"
volumes: - ./backend:/app
command: uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0
frontend:
build: ./frontend
ports: - "3000:3000"
volumes: - ./frontend:/app
command: npm start
Build and run the containers:

bash
Copy
docker-compose up --build
This will set up both the backend and frontend services, and you can access them at http://localhost:8000 and http://localhost:3000, respectively.
